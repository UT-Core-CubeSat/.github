# Welcome to UT-CORE 🚀  

**UT-CORE** is an open-source, student-designed CubeSat bus built at Utah Tech University for real space missions.

UT-CORE isn’t just a class project. It’s a fully modular, flight-intended CubeSat platform designed to power current and future Utah Tech missions — from SOLACE and beyond.

We design everything in-house:

- Custom STM32-based flight computers  
- Redundant CAN bus architecture  
- ADCS with reaction wheels and sensor fusion  
- EPS, backplanes, and power distribution  
- Payload interfaces for imaging and research missions  

Engineered by students.

Designing, building, and testing spacecraft isn’t easy.  
But we’re not here to do easy.

We’re here to build a CubeSat bus that lasts — a platform Utah Tech can launch again and again.

We’re building flight hardware.  
And we’re going to space. 🚀
